### 📼 Origin Story

I have been fascinated with code since I was 11, back when I used to copy [**`DEBUG`**][debug] and BASIC program listings out of magazines. Before I had started high school I was branded a hacker, banned from school labs for curiosity "gone too far". By then it was [BBSes][], [demo scenes][], and homebrew that each injected Open Source into my veins and by my late teens I had fallen in love with the community.

At 22 I was starting to get paid, becoming a video game programmer.

### 🗣️ My Deal

I get excited by solving weird or tough problems. The dizzying hunt for the elusive solution never gets old. Even better is to be the person called in to solve those problems, gradually becoming an expert in many things but a master of none. You've probably caught on that I'm making a connection as to why I love Open Source. It's a never-ending party of odd personalities, immaculate code, and unlimited<span title="powah"> </span>weird and tough problems.

I am employed full-time at @americanexpress. <span title="I enjoy the culture at Amex that confronts bias and inequality, champions diversity, and contributes to Open Source." >I contribute to the organization's GitHub repositories and also work on internal projects that I hope to open source.</span>

### 🙇🏽 Thank You

Becoming a sponsor means I'll focus more :energy: :lighting: into my personal projects.

My current groove is tooling, I'm building on my on VS Code extensions, and contributing to several others.

I'd rather solve weird problems or fill in gaps I think are useful for me and others. Also to be the person they call to solve those problems. Some people like to get down with Advent of Code and hackathons but I'd rather hack on a useful problem others would give up on, or thing too intimidating

Video games, UX, backends, 3D printing, Raspberry Pi, (:home:) automation, TypeScript, Svelte, React. If it affects others in a big way
